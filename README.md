# Grayratio

Blah blah blah...

Apparently, this is a _big deal_ for a modern dater.

Thankfully, now that iMessage runs locally on MacOSX, many of us have a handy
unencrypted copy of our message database we can easily access to solve this
problem via _science_.


Graymatter will simply check your messages for the past 30 days, and give you a
list of the top 10 people you've been texted with, and what the ratio is with
each of them.

## Usage
Clone this repo, and then when within the directory, do:

    ./grayratio.sh

You're probably smart enough to figure out how to modify the script if you want
some other information.

## TODO
I've considered wrapping this as a nicely formatted command line program that
takes options from the CLI, etc.  But I'm not sure if anyone actually wants
that!  So if you do, just let me know.
